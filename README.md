# Dev-Tools-UI
This UI is made to help script developers make their scripts without alt tabbing out into their executor. 

The garbage colletor button is broken I know, I will fix it when I feel like it. For now, just copy and paste it from the button in the source code! Thanks skids!


(Scroll down for screenshots and more details)

# Paste
Copy the script here:

```lua

--Script:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevontavius/Dev-Tools-UI/main/script/Dev-Tools.lua'))()
